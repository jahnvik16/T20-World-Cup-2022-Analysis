# T20-World-Cup-2022-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the T20 World Cup 2022 using Python and various data visualization libraries. It provides insights into match outcomes, player performances, and venue statistics.

## Data Source
The analysis uses data from the "t20-world-cup-22.csv" file, which contains detailed information about each match in the tournament.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects for interactive visualizations

## Key Features

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Utilizes Pandas to read and process the CSV file
   - Displays the first few rows of the dataset for initial inspection

2. **Match Outcome Analysis**
   - Visualizes the distribution of matches won by runs vs. wickets using a pie chart

3. **Toss Decision Analysis**
   - Presents a pie chart showing the frequency of batting vs. fielding decisions after winning the toss

4. **Player Performance Analysis**
   - Bar charts for:
     - Top scorers and their highest scores
     - Players with the most "Player of the Match" awards
     - Best bowlers in the tournament

5. **Venue Analysis**
   - Compares first and second innings performances across different stadiums:
     - Runs scored in each innings
     - Wickets taken in each innings

## Visualizations
The project includes several interactive visualizations:
1. Pie charts for match outcomes and toss decisions
2. Bar charts for individual player performances
3. Grouped bar charts for stadium-wise analysis of batting and bowling performances

## Key Insights
(You can add specific insights from your analysis here. For example:)
- X% of matches were won by the team batting first
- Y was the highest individual score in the tournament
- Z stadium saw the highest average first innings score
